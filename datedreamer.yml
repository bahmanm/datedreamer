## Configuration options for Date Dreamer
##

# How many data points to generate?
# Though a bigger value means better precision, it comes at the price of speed
# and the size of the image. Usually 20000 is a good balance.
nPoints: 20000

# Where to output the plot?
# Can be 'file', 'ui' or 'both'.
outputMode: ui

# Where to write the image file?
# In case `outputMode` is set to `file` or `both`, this is the path to the file.
filePath: datedreamer.png

# What is the width of the image in pixels?
# Scales the width and height of the original image so that the width is
# `width`.
# For instance, if the original image is 300x100 and `width` is set to 800,
# the output dimensions will be 800x267.
width: 900

# Instructions for Date Dreamer to generate frames as the "dreaming" happens!
# If enabled, after generating certain number of points Date Dreamer will write
# the resulting (partial) plot to a file.
frames:
  # Is framed rendering enabled?
  # If set to `no`, none of the other options will have any effect whatsoever.
  # If set to `yes`, `filePath` and `nPoints` will have no effect.
  enabled: no

  # In which directory to place the frames?
  # The directory should already exist and be accessible to Date Dreamer.
  directory: .
  
  # What is the prefix of the partial image files?
  # Date Dreamer will write image files with a simple naming convention:
  # `prefix+i`. For instance: `frame-0.png`, `frame-1.png`, ...
  prefix: 'frame-'

  # Data to generate the frames. Each set contains the number of points in each
  # frame and the number of frames.
  data:
    - nPoints: 100
      nRepeat: 15
    - nPoints: 500
      nRepeat: 13
    - nPoints: 1000
      nRepeat: 13
    
# What is the initial seed to f(i)?
# Probably you don't need to change this. That said, take a look at the README 
# for a better understanding.
