# Though a bigger value means better precision, it comes at the price of speed
# and the size of the image. Usually 20000 is a good balance.

# Where to output the plot?
# Can be 'file', 'ui' or 'both'.
outputMode: both

# Where to write the image file?
# In case `outputMode` is set to `file`, this is the path to the file.
filePath: 'datedreamer.png'

# What is the initial seed to f(i)?
# Probably you don't need to change this. That said, take a look at the README 
# for a better understanding.
