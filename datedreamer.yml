# How many data points to generate?
# Though a bigger value means better precision, it comes at the price of speed
# and the size of the image. Usually 20000 is a good balance.
nPoints: 20000

# Where to output the plot?
# Can be 'file', 'ui' or 'both'.
outputMode: ui

# Where to write the image file?
# In case `outputMode` is set to `file` or `both`, this is the path to the file.
filePath: 'datedreamer.png'

# What is the width of the image in pixels?
# Scales the width and height of the original image so that the width is
# `width`.
# For instance, if the original image is 300x100 and `width` is set to 800,
# the output dimensions will be 800x267.
width: 900

# What is the initial seed to f(i)?
# Probably you don't need to change this. That said, take a look at the README 
# for a better understanding.
